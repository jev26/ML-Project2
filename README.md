# EPFL ML Recommender System

This repository contains the code necessary to run a Recommender System for movie ratings for the CS-433 Machine Learning course et EPFL.
The dataset comes from the [crowdAI Platform](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/epfl-ml-recommender-system) and consist of ratings of 10000 users for 1000 different movies.
We are supposed to predict good recommendations, e.g. of movies to users. All ratings are integer values between 1 and 5 stars.

The code is written in Python and run on Jupyter notebooks

## Team members

- BARAKAT Arthur
- VEILLARD Jennifer
- NGUYEN Lo√Øc

## External libraries needed

All these librairies should be installed in order for the code to run:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- pickle
- pandas
- seaborn
- [surprise](http://surpriselib.com/)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Prerequisites

* Download the dataset from the [crowdAI challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/epfl-ml-recommender-system/dataset_files) website and place them in the `data/` folder.
Create one if it is not present. 
**Important:** The sample submission file should be renamed as `sampleSubmission.csv` and the name of the train data should be `47b05e70-6076-44e8-96da-2530dc2187de_data_train.csv`

* All the models were already computed and saved as pickle files in order to save some time.
    * The `models` folders contains all the predictions for a testset and trained on a 90/10 split. That folder also contains the splitted trainset, testset and corresponding labels.
    * The `models_final` folders contains all the predictions for the crowdAI and trained on the full dataset
    * If the files are not provided, they either need to generated by running both #TODO and #TODO files, or the can be downloaded on the following link #TODO.
       

## Description of files

* `run.ipynb` contains the jupyter notebook that does the blending and generates the submission file




## Creating submission

In order to create the submission, you have to:
* Entierly run the `run.ipynb` file, the submission will be generated as #TODO name here
